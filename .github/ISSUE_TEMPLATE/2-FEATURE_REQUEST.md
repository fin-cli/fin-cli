## Feature Request

<!--- ⚠️ Before you describe your requested feature... ---

**Is your feature request directly related to a specific, existing command?**

If yes, make sure you are in the correct repository that contains the command you are referring to, and only create the issue in that repository.

Here's a quick overview of where to find the different commands:

If you are not in the correct repository right now, you can just close this issue/window without submitting and click through to the correct one.

**Is your feature request about a new command, or a more general idea?**

If your feature request is not about making a change to one or more existing commands, but rather about adding functionality that doesn't naturally fit one of the existing commands, head over to the [`fp-cli/ideas`](https://github.com/fp-cli/ideas) repository and [create a new issue in that repository](https://github.com/fp-cli/ideas/issues/new).

The issue tracker in that repository will collect ideas that are still vague and need fleshing out and/or preparatory work (like creating a new repository) before the actual development work can begin.
