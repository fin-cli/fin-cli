## Feature Request

<!--- ⚠️ Before you describe your requested feature... ---

**Is your feature request directly related to a specific, existing command?**

If yes, make sure you are in the correct repository that contains the command you are referring to, and only create the issue in that repository.

If you are not in the correct repository right now, you can just close this issue/window without submitting and click through to the correct one.

**Is your feature request about a new command, or a more general idea?**

If your feature request is not about making a change to one or more existing commands, but rather about adding functionality that doesn't naturally fit one of the existing commands, head over to the [`fin-cli/ideas`](https://github.com/fin-cli/ideas) repository and [create a new issue in that repository](https://github.com/fin-cli/ideas/issues/new).

The issue tracker in that repository will collect ideas that are still vague and need fleshing out and/or preparatory work (like creating a new repository) before the actual development work can begin.
