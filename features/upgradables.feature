    Given a WP install
    And download:
      | path                   | url       |
      | {CACHE_DIR}/<item>.zip | <zip_file> |
    And I run `wp <type> path`
    And save STDOUT as {CONTENT_DIR}

    # ï»¿Install an out of date <item> from WordPress.org repository
    When I run `wp <type> install <item> --version=<version>`
    Then STDOUT should contain:
      """
      <type_name> installed successfully
      """

    When I run `wp <type> status`
    Then STDOUT should contain:
      """
      U = Update Available
      """

    When I run `wp <type> status <item>`
    Then STDOUT should contain:
      """
          Status: Inactive
          Version: <version> (Update available)

    Then STDOUT should contain:
      """
      Success: Deleted '<item>' <type>.
      """

    When I try `wp <type> status <item>`
    Then the return code should be 1
    And STDERR should not be empty


    # Install <item> from a local zip file
    When I run `wp <type> install {CACHE_DIR}/<item>.zip`
    Then STDOUT should contain:
    """
    <type_name> installed successfully.
    """
    And the <file_to_check> file should exist

    When I run `wp <type> delete <item>`
    Then STDOUT should contain:
    """

    """
    And the <file_to_check> file should not exist

    # Install <item> from a remote zip file (standard URL with no GET parameters)
    When I run `wp <type> install <zip_file>`
    Then STDOUT should contain:
    """
    <type_name> installed successfully.

    # Install <item> from a remote zip file (complex URL with GET parameters)
    When I run `wp <type> install '<zip_file>?AWSAccessKeyId=123&Expires=456&Signature=abcdef'`
    Then STDOUT should contain:
    """

    And STDOUT should end with a table containing rows:
      | name         | slug   |
      | <item_title> | <item> |
